# TechGirlyBlog
This repository contains my solution to the Blog Challenge. In this challenge, I have developed a simple blog application with some of the specified features. Below you'll find information about the project.

Project Overview
The blog's application is intended to allows users to create, view, and interact with blog posts. It includes the following features:

Landing page displaying a form to submit a new blog post.
There is supposed to be a place for use of storage of blog post data using localStorage.
I have implemented a "Dark mode" functionality, in case of preference.
Eventually, there will be navigation between the landing page and individual blog posts.
Simple and intuitive user interface design.

Usage
To run the blog application locally, follow these steps:

Additional Notes
The project structure follows best practices for web development, including separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and use of semantic markup.

I have tested the application and although all of the functionality is not responsive, I'd like to submit for feedback as I have confused myself.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
